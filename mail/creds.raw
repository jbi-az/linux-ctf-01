Subject: DRIP design image on website  

Hi Jasper,

The concept website looks really good! 

We would like to add a picture of the DRIP design on the website.

You can find the design in our project folder /usr/share/icarus
Only you probably don't have access to this folder.

Login with Boris' account for the time being.  

username: borish
password: icarus123!@#

I will send you an instruction mail on how to extract the design.

The design image itself is on page ... 

Remember: keep the design confidential at all cost.

Kind regards,
Laurens Martha
Lead engineer / project-i
