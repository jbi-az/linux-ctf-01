Subject: Confidential - instruction  

Hi Jasper,

Hereby the instruction. Keep confidential and delete everything when finished. 

1. There is a compressed file 'drip' in /usr/share/icarus that has the design.

2. Decompress the file. It is password protected, I will send the passcode by Whatsapp

3. Concate the four parts into a new file called 'tmp' 

4. This file is raw hexadecimal output, compile into binary with the command 'xxd -r -p tmp'
   and redirect to a file called 'icarus' 

5. You can open the file on any desktop machine.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

Kind regards,
Laurens Martha
Lead engineer / project-i
